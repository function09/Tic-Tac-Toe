# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic game, Tic-Tac-Toe. I was tasked by the Odin Project to create a web version of Tic-Tac-Toe using only module patterns and factory functions with as little to no global variables. Overall this project allowed me to test and practice my knowledge of the module pattern and factory functions.
